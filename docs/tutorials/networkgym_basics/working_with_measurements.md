# Working with Measurements

Personalizing the observation and reward functions to match your experimental goals is achievable within the provided environments. Within the `Adapter` class for each environment, both the `get_observation` and `get_reward` functions take a network statistics measurement as input. An illustration of such a network statistics measurement is provided below:

```
             id      name  source    ts                             value
0  [1, 2, 3, 4]  dl::rate     gma  6000  [11.616, 11.616, 16.024, 57.144]
```

## Measurement Columns

The network statistics measurement contains 5 columns, with each field's explanation provided below:

| Column | Description |
| ----- | ---- |
| id | Represents the unique identifier for the measurement entity list. By default, it corresponds to a user ID. However, it could the refers a cell ID or flow ID in some measurements. For instance, `dl::max_rate` measures the maximum rate per user, whereas `dl:cell:::max_rate` measures the maximum rate per cell.|
| name | Denotes the name of the measurement. The naming convention includes descriptive tags that can be prefixed to the name and separated by `::`. For example, a measurement capturing traffic ratio over an LTE link and downlink direction might be represented as `lte::dl::traffic_ratio`.|
| source | Indicates the origin providing the measurement data, such as lte.|
| ts | Represents the timestamp indicating when the measurement was recorded.|
| value | Stores the value of the measurement. The value is stored as a list, and its size matches that of the corresponding `id`. Elements can be numerical, or JSON objects to store more complex data structure. |

## Retrieving a Measurement

To subscribe to a specific measurement, add its `source`::`name` combination to the "subscribed_network_stats" list. For example, appending `gma::dl::rate` to the list would enable receiving measurements with the name `dl::rate` from the source `gma`. After subscription, in the `get_observation` or `get_reward` function, you can utilize the following code to retrieve it:
```python
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    if row['source'] == 'gma':
        if row['name'] == 'dl::rate':
            df_rate = row
            print(df_rate)
```
