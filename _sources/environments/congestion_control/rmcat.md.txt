[config.json]: https://github.com/IntelLabs/networkgym/blob/main/network_gym_client/envs/rmcat/config.json

The RMCAT environment is part of the congestion control environments and provides general information about the environment.
In this environment, the agent performs periodic actions to adjust the sending rate of a real-time traffic flow using RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT).
This environment is based on the GitHub Repo: [cisco/ns3-rmcat](https://github.com/cisco/ns3-rmcat).

## Description

The RMCAT environment represents a congestion control problem for real-time traffic. The goal of congestion control is to strategically control the sending rate, aiming to achieve high throughput, low latency, and low loss. If no action is given to the environment, RMCAT uses [NADA](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-rmcat-nada-05) as its default algorithm.

## Prerequisite

Ensure that you have access to the NetworkGym Server on [vLab](https://registration.intel-research.net/) machines and have downloaded the [NetworkGym](https://github.com/IntelLabs/networkgym).

## Arguments

The arguements for this environment can be customized in the [config.json] file. When the client initiates, the JSON file is loaded and sent to the server to set up the environment.

## Measurements

Edit the "subscribed_network_stats" in the [config.json] to include only the necessary measurements required for computing observations and rewards. This minimizes the transmission of 'unused' data and reduces overhead. A complete list of available measurements is povided in the following:

To subscribe to a specific measurement, add its `source`::`name` combination to the "subscribed_network_stats" list. For example, appending `rmcat::rtt` to the list would enable receiving measurements with the name `rtt` from the source `rmcat`. Refer to [Working with Measurements](../../tutorials/networkgym_basics/working_with_measurements.md) for further elaboration of the measurements.

## Observation Space

The observation is an `ndarray` with shape `(3,)` representing three features selected from the available measurements for this environment. 

The first feature is `rtt`, representing the round trip time. The second feature is `xcurr`, represeting the congestion level. The third feature is the received throughput `rrate`.

| Feature | Observation | Min | Max |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| 0 | rtt (ms) | 0.0 | Inf |
| 1 | xcurr | 0.0 | 500.0 |
| 2 | rrate (bps) | 0.0 | Inf|

## Action Space
The action space is a `ndarray` with shape `(1,)` representing the sending rate of rmcat flow. The min value is 150000 and max value is 1500000.


## Reward

Not implemented yet.

## Customize Observation Space and Reward

```{eval-rst}
- Customize Observation Space in the :meth:`network_gym_client.envs.rmcat.Adapter.get_observation` function.
- Customize Reward in the :meth:`network_gym_client.envs.rmcat.Adapter.get_reward` function.
```


## Episode End
A NetworkGym environment operates for a specified number of episodes, denoted as episodes_per_session (E), and each episode is truncated after a certain number of time steps, denoted as steps_per_episode (L). Resulting in E*L time steps per environment session. Both E and L can be customized through [config.json].
The episode ends if either of the following happens:
1. Truncation: The length of each episode is L steps. Once an episode is truncated, the environment continues to run, generating results for the subsequent episode. Itâ€™s important to note that the environment parameters cannot be reconfigured after the end of a truncated episode.
2. Termination: The environment terminates after E episodes. At this point, the agent has the option to reconfigure the environment to continue training or to exit the program entirely.
