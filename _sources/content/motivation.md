## Where is Data?

## Network AI Developer Challenges (Why NetworkGym?)
- real-world dataset controlled by network operator, difficult to acquire, not aligned with specific usage or requirement.
- dataset by itself not enough, also need environment to train/test AI models, e.g. Reinforcement Learning, etc.
- network simulation tools (e.g., ns3, etc.) often very complex and difficult to use, especially for Network AI researcher & developer.
- lack of common simulation environment with simple APIs to develop, evaluate, and benchmark Network AI models & algorithms.
