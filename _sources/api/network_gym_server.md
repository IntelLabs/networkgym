The NetworkGymServer includes two components, the **northbound interface** manages the connections with the clients, and the **southbound interface** manages the connections with the environments.
When a client connects, the server selects an idle environment instance and add the client to envrionment mapping to the routing table.

At present, we do not plan to release the network_gym_server software.
